This Repo contains a small project on converting english sentences to french sentence using an encoder-decoder architecture; 
We also explore the challenges that such models face, and the importance of the attention mechanism !!!
This comparison is available in the "latex" folder. 
To play around with the models, please pull this directory and run the "website.py" locally on your machine. 
Keep in mind that in this model, I did NOT include attention mechanism; Here I only used LSTMs (encoder-decoder) architecture, alongside teacher forcing in the decoder; 
For the explanation of the model, please checkout this unlisted youtube video:
